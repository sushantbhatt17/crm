## Quick Start

### 1. Create & Activate Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project's packages isolated from other Python projects.

**Step 1 — Create the venv (run once):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Step 2 — Activate it:**

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| Windows (CMD) | `venv\Scripts\activate` |
| Windows (PowerShell) | `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Mac / Linux | `source venv/bin/activate` |

> ✅ You'll know it's active when you see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal line.

> ⚠️ **PowerShell error?** Run this once as Administrator, then retry:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
> ```

**Step 3 — Deactivate when done (optional):**
```bash
deactivate
```

> 🔁 Every time you open a new terminal to work on this project, re-run the activate command before anything else.

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MySQL credentials
```

### 4. Create the database
```bash
mysql -u root -p < migrations/schema.sql
```

### 5. Run the server
```bash
python run.py
# Server starts at http://localhost:5000
```

## Pipeline Stages (in order)
```
New Lead → Contacted → Demo → Negotiation → Won → Lost
```
- When a lead reaches **Won**, it is **automatically converted to a Customer**.
- **Won** and **Lost** are terminal stages — they cannot be advanced further.
